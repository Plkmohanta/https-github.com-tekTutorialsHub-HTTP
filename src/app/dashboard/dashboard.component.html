  This guide describes development of a multi-page routed sample application. Along the way, it highlights design decisions and describes key features of the router such as:

Organizing the application features into modules.
Navigating to a component (Heroes link to "Heroes List").
Including a route parameter (passing the Hero id while routing to the "Hero Detail").
Child routes (the Crisis Center has its own routes).
The CanActivate guard (checking route access).
The CanActivateChild guard (checking child route access).
The CanDeactivate guard (ask permission to discard unsaved changes).
The Resolve guard (pre-fetching route data).
Lazy loading feature modules.
The CanLoad guard (check before loading feature module assets).
